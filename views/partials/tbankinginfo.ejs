      <h1>Learn more about table banking</h1>
      Table banking is a concept similar to the merry-go-round.  The only difference is
      that the money contributed by the members is not given to one person to take home. 
      What happens is that the money is collected and then members take soft loans until
      all the money is used up.  During the next meeting, each member pays back her
      loan with an interest varying from 10 to 20 percent, depending on what the group
      decides.  This way, the money keeps growing and more money is available for
       members to borrow every time. On their meetings the members make other
      contributions, repay their loans, borrow loans either as long term or short term
      and also place their saving. In table banking the priority to access loans is
      given to the poor to improve their financial status. In table banking, the
      difference is that the group guarantees you, and your household items (TVs,
      Chairs for example) are the only collateral you need to qualify for the loan.
      Table-banking methodology is not based on assessing the material possession
      of a person; it is based on the potential of a person. Joining a table banking
      group is so easy, you only need to find an active one that you are very familiar
       with the members then pay the membership amount and start making you contribution.
